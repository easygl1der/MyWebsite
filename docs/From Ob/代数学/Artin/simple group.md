In group theory, a branch of mathematics, a **simple group** is a nontrivial group that does not have any nontrivial normal subgroups other than itself and the trivial subgroup. In other words, a group $G$ is simple if it satisfies the following conditions:

1. $G$ is not the trivial group, which consists of only the identity element.
2. The only normal subgroups of $G$ are the trivial subgroup $\{e\}$ and the group $G$ itself.

Simple groups are the building blocks for all finite groups in the sense that, according to the Jordan-HÃ¶lder theorem, every finite group can be decomposed into a series of simple groups through a process called composition series.

A few important examples of simple groups are:

- The cyclic groups of prime order $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$, where $p$ is a prime number.
- The alternating group $A_n$ for $n \geq 5$.
- The finite simple groups of Lie type, such as $\mathrm{PSL}_2(p)$ for prime $p$.

The classification of finite simple groups is a monumental result in mathematics, which states that every finite simple group belongs to one of several broad categories: cyclic groups of prime order, alternating groups, groups of Lie type, and 26 sporadic groups.
