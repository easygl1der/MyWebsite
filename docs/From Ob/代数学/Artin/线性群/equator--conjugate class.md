The notion of the "equator" in $SU(2)$ can indeed be interpreted in terms of conjugacy classes, which are important in the context of Lie groups and their representations.

### Conjugacy Classes in $SU(2)$

A conjugacy class in a group $G$ is the set of elements that are conjugate to each other, meaning for $g \in G$:

$$
\text{Conjugacy class of } g = \{ hgh^{-1} : h \in G \}.
$$

### Conjugacy Classes in $SU(2)$

For $SU(2)$, the elements are $2 \times 2$ unitary matrices with determinant 1. Any element $U \in SU(2)$ can be written as:

$$
U = \begin{pmatrix}
\alpha & -\beta^* \\
\beta & \alpha^*
\end{pmatrix}, \quad \text{where} \ |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1.
$$

Conjugacy classes in $SU(2)$ are determined by the trace of the matrix, which is invariant under conjugation. The trace $\text{Tr}(U)$ is given by:

$$
\text{Tr}(U) = \alpha + \alpha^* = 2 \Re(\alpha).
$$

Since $\alpha = a + bi$ (with $a^2 + b^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$), the trace becomes:

$$
\text{Tr}(U) = 2a.
$$

### Equator as a Conjugacy Class

The "equator" of $SU(2)$, as we interpreted geometrically, can be linked to a specific value of the trace. For example, if we consider matrices with $a = 0$, then:

$$
\text{Tr}(U) = 0.
$$

These matrices form a conjugacy class where the trace is zero. This subset of $SU(2)$ corresponds to matrices that can be written in the form:

$$
U = \begin{pmatrix}
bi & -\beta^* \\
\beta & -bi
\end{pmatrix}, \quad \text{where} \ b^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1.
$$

This forms a lower-dimensional manifold within $SU(2)$ and can be visualized as the "equator" on the 3-sphere $S^3$.

### Conclusion

The "equator" in $SU(2)$ corresponds to a conjugacy class with a specific trace value. In this case, matrices with a trace of zero form a conjugacy class that geometrically represents a 2-sphere $S^2$ within the 3-sphere $S^3$. This interpretation ties the geometric notion of the equator to the algebraic structure of conjugacy classes in $SU(2)$.
