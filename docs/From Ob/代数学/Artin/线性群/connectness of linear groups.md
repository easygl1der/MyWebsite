### 1. **Special Linear Group $SL_n(\mathbb{R})$**

- **Definition**: $SL_n(\mathbb{R})$ is the group of $n \times n$ real matrices with determinant 1.
- **Connectedness**: For $n \geq 2$, $SL_n(\mathbb{R})$ is connected. This means there is a path between any two elements in the group. In fact, it is a simple Lie group, which implies it has no non-trivial normal subgroups.

### 2. **General Linear Group $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$**

- **Definition**: $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ is the group of $n \times n$ invertible real matrices.
- **Connectedness**: $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ is not connected. It has two components:
    - The component consisting of matrices with positive determinant (which is path-connected).
    - The component consisting of matrices with negative determinant (also path-connected). Thus, $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ is a disjoint union of these two components.

### 3. **Special Orthogonal Group $SO_n(\mathbb{R})$**

- **Definition**: $SO_n(\mathbb{R})$ is the group of $n \times n$ orthogonal matrices with determinant 1.
- **Connectedness**: $SO_n(\mathbb{R})$ is connected for $n \geq 2$. It is a compact Lie group and is path-connected. For $n = 2$, it is topologically equivalent to the circle $S^1$.

### 4. **Orthogonal Group $O_n(\mathbb{R})$**

- **Definition**: $O_n(\mathbb{R})$ is the group of $n \times n$ orthogonal matrices with determinant $\pm 1$.
- **Connectedness**: $O_n(\mathbb{R})$ is not connected. It has two components:
    - The component consisting of matrices with determinant 1, which is $SO_n(\mathbb{R})$ (connected).
    - The component consisting of matrices with determinant -1, which is disconnected from $SO_n(\mathbb{R})$.

### 5. **Special Unitary Group $SU_n(\mathbb{C})$**

- **Definition**: $SU_n(\mathbb{C})$ is the group of $n \times n$ unitary matrices with determinant 1.
- **Connectedness**: $SU_n(\mathbb{C})$ is connected for all $n \geq 1$. It is a compact, connected Lie group. For $n = 2$, it is topologically equivalent to the 3-sphere $S^3$.

### 6. **Unitary Group $U_n(\mathbb{C})$**

- **Definition**: $U_n(\mathbb{C})$ is the group of $n \times n$ unitary matrices.
- **Connectedness**: $U_n(\mathbb{C})$ is connected. It is a compact Lie group and has a connected topology. It is the complex generalization of the orthogonal group $O_n(\mathbb{R})$, with all matrices having determinant of absolute value 1, not just $\pm 1$.
