In the context of the general linear group $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$, which consists of all $n \times n$ invertible matrices with real entries, a path is typically a continuous function from the interval $[0, 1]$ to $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$.

Formally, a path in $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ is a continuous map:

$$ \gamma: [0, 1] \to GL_n(\mathbb{R}) $$

This means for each $t \in [0, 1]$, $\gamma(t)$ is an $n \times n$ invertible matrix, and the function $\gamma$ is continuous with respect to the topology on $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ induced by the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$.

### Examples

1. **Straight Line Path**: Consider the matrices $A, B \in GL_n(\mathbb{R})$. A simple example of a path between $A$ and $B$ is given by:
   $$ \gamma(t) = (1 - t)A + tB \quad \text{for} \ t \in [0, 1] $$
   provided that $\gamma(t) \in GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ for all $t \in [0, 1]$.

2. **Exponential Map**: Given a matrix $A \in GL_n(\mathbb{R})$, a common path starting from the identity matrix $I$ is:
   $$ \gamma(t) = \exp(t \log(A)) \quad \text{for} \ t \in [0, 1] $$
   Here, $\log(A)$ is the matrix logarithm of $A$ and $\exp$ is the matrix exponential. This ensures that $\gamma(0) = I$ and $\gamma(1) = A$.

### Properties

- **Homotopy**: Two paths $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ in $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ are said to be homotopic if there exists a continuous map $H: [0, 1] \times [0, 1] \to GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ such that:
  $$ H(t, 0) = \gamma_0(t), \quad H(t, 1) = \gamma_1(t), \quad H(0, s) = I, \quad H(1, s) = A $$
  for all $t, s \in [0, 1]$.

- **Fundamental Group**: The set of all loops (paths that start and end at the same point) in $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ based at the identity matrix, up to homotopy, forms the fundamental group $\pi_1(GL_n(\mathbb{R}), I)$. For $n \geq 2$, this fundamental group is known to be isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, reflecting the fact that $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ has two connected components: matrices with positive determinant and matrices with negative determinant. For $n = 1$, $\pi_1(GL_1(\mathbb{R}), I)$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$.

Understanding paths in $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ is essential in various areas of mathematics, including differential topology, algebraic geometry, and the study of Lie groups and their representations.
