The compactness of the matrix groups $SL_n$, $GL_n$, $SO_n$, $O_n$, $SU_n$, and $U_n$ varies depending on the specific group. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of their compactness:

### 1. **Special Linear Group $SL_n(\mathbb{R})$**

- **Definition**: $SL_n(\mathbb{R})$ is the group of $n \times n$ real matrices with determinant 1.
- **Compactness**:
  - **For $n \geq 2$**: $SL_n(\mathbb{R})$ is **not compact**. It is a closed subset of the general linear group $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$, which is open in $\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$. While $SL_n(\mathbb{R})$ is closed, it is not bounded. The reason for this is that matrices in $SL_n(\mathbb{R})$ can have arbitrarily large norms. For example, diagonal matrices with entries increasing without bound (while maintaining determinant 1) show that $SL_n(\mathbb{R})$ is unbounded in $\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$.
  - **For $n = 1$**: $SL_1(\mathbb{R})$ consists of the single matrix $[1]$, which is compact because it is a finite set.

### 2. **General Linear Group $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$**

- **Definition**: $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ is the group of $n \times n$ invertible real matrices.
- **Compactness**:
  - $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ is **not compact**. It is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$, and hence it is unbounded. Specifically, matrices in $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ can have entries with arbitrarily large magnitudes, leading to a lack of boundedness. For instance, one can construct matrices with entries growing without bound, which would still be invertible.

### 3. **Special Orthogonal Group $SO_n(\mathbb{R})$**

- **Definition**: $SO_n(\mathbb{R})$ is the group of $n \times n$ orthogonal matrices with determinant 1.
- **Compactness**:
  - **For $n \geq 2$**: $SO_n(\mathbb{R})$ is **compact**. It is a closed subset of $O_n(\mathbb{R})$, which is the group of all orthogonal matrices (with determinant $\pm 1$). Since $O_n(\mathbb{R})$ is compact and $SO_n(\mathbb{R})$ is a closed subgroup of it, $SO_n(\mathbb{R})$ inherits compactness. Additionally, $SO_n(\mathbb{R})$ is bounded because all orthogonal matrices have norm 1, and it can be shown to be a compact Lie group.

### 4. **Orthogonal Group $O_n(\mathbb{R})$**

- **Definition**: $O_n(\mathbb{R})$ is the group of $n \times n$ orthogonal matrices with determinant $\pm 1$.
- **Compactness**:
  - $O_n(\mathbb{R})$ is **compact**. It is a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$ and is bounded. The compactness can be seen from the fact that orthogonal matrices satisfy $A^T A = I$, which restricts their entries, and hence, they form a bounded set in $\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$. This group includes matrices with determinant 1 (forming $SO_n(\mathbb{R})$) and those with determinant -1, but remains compact as it is the union of these two compact sets.

### 5. **Special Unitary Group $SU_n(\mathbb{C})$**

- **Definition**: $SU_n(\mathbb{C})$ is the group of $n \times n$ unitary matrices with determinant 1.
- **Compactness**:
  - $SU_n(\mathbb{C})$ is **compact**. It is a closed and bounded subset of the unitary group $U_n(\mathbb{C})$, which consists of all unitary matrices. The compactness comes from the fact that $SU_n(\mathbb{C})$ is a closed subgroup of $U_n(\mathbb{C})$ (which is compact). The condition that unitary matrices have norm 1 ensures boundedness, and the determinant condition does not affect the compactness.

### 6. **Unitary Group $U_n(\mathbb{C})$**

- **Definition**: $U_n(\mathbb{C})$ is the group of $n \times n$ unitary matrices.
- **Compactness**:
  - $U_n(\mathbb{C})$ is **compact**. It is a closed subset of $\mathbb{C}^{n^2}$, and unitary matrices have entries satisfying certain norm conditions, which ensures boundedness. The compactness can be attributed to the fact that unitary matrices are defined by the equation $U^* U = I$, where $U^*$ is the conjugate transpose, enforcing a bounded structure.

### Summary

- **$SL_n(\mathbb{R})$**: Not compact for $n \geq 2$, compact for $n = 1$.
- **$GL_n(\mathbb{R})$**: Not compact; unbounded.
- **$SO_n(\mathbb{R})$**: Compact for $n \geq 2$.
- **$O_n(\mathbb{R})$**: Compact.
- **$SU_n(\mathbb{C})$**: Compact.
- **$U_n(\mathbb{C})$**: Compact.
