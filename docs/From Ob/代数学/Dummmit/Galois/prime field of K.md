## ✍内容
The **prime field** of a field $K$ is the intersection of all subfields of $K$. It is denoted by either $\mathbb{F}_p$ or $\mathbb{Q}$, depending on the characteristic of the field $K$:

* **If $K$ has characteristic $p$**, where $p$ is a prime number, then the prime field of $K$ is isomorphic to the finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$ with $p$ elements. This field is obtained by taking the integers modulo $p$.

* **If $K$ has characteristic 0**, then the prime field of $K$ is isomorphic to the field of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$.

**In simpler terms:**

The prime field of a field is *the "smallest" field contained within it*. It's like the foundation upon which the larger field is built. If the field has a prime characteristic, its prime field is like a clock face with a prime number of hours. If the field has characteristic 0, its prime field is like the familiar rational numbers.
