Let $F$ be a field and let $f(x)$ be a polynomial in $F[x]$, where $F[x]$ denotes the ring of polynomials with coefficients in $F$.

A **splitting field** of $f(x)$ over $F$ is a field extension $K$ of $F$ such that:

1. **$f(x)$ splits completely in $K[x]$**, meaning that $f(x)$ can be factored into linear factors in $K[x]$. In other words, we can write:

   $$f(x) = c(x - \alpha_1)(x - \alpha_2) \dotsm (x - \alpha_n)$$

   where $c \in F$ and $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots, \alpha_n \in K$ are the roots of $f(x)$.

2. **$K$ is the smallest field extension of $F$ containing all the roots of $f(x)$**. This means that $K = F(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots, \alpha_n)$, the smallest field containing $F$ and all the roots of $f(x)$.

**In simpler terms:** The splitting field of a polynomial is the smallest field extension where the polynomial completely factors into linear terms.
