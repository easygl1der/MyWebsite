## ✍内容
Let $F$ be a field and let $f(x)$ be a polynomial in $F[x]$, where $F[x]$ denotes the ring of polynomials with coefficients in $F$.

We say that $f(x)$ is **separable** if it has no multiple roots in its splitting field. In other words, $f(x)$ is separable if and only if the following two conditions hold:

1. **$f(x)$ is not the zero polynomial.**
2. **The roots of $f(x)$ in its splitting field $K$ are all distinct.**

Equivalently, $f(x)$ is separable if and only if its derivative $f'(x)$ is relatively prime to $f(x)$ in $F[x]$. This means that the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $f'(x)$ is 1.

**Example:**

* The polynomial $x^2 - 2$ is separable over the field of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ because its roots, $\sqrt{2}$ and $-\sqrt{2}$, are distinct.
* The polynomial $x^2 - 1 = (x-1)(x+1)$ is separable over $\mathbb{Q}$ as it factors into distinct linear factors.
* The polynomial $x^2$ is not separable over any field because its derivative, $2x$, shares a common factor of $x$ with the original polynomial. This indicates a multiple root at $x=0$.

**Significance:**

The concept of separability is important in Galois theory, which studies the relationship between field extensions and groups of automorphisms. Separable extensions, which are generated by roots of separable polynomials, have particularly nice properties in this context.
