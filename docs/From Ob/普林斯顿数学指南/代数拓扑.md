## 介值定理是拓扑性质
We can use the idea of connectedness to prove a serious theorem of algebra: every real polynomial of odd degree has a real root. For example, there must be some real number $x$ such that $x^3+3 x-4=0$. The basic observation is that when $x$ is a large positive number or a highly negative number, the term $x^3$ is much bigger (in absolute value) than the other terms of the polynomial. Since this top term is an odd power of $x$, we have $f(x)>0$ for some positive number $x$ and $f(x)<0$ for some negative number $x$. If $f$ were never equal to zero, then it would be a continuous mapping from the real line into the real line minus the origin. But the real line is connected, while the real line minus the origin has two connected components, the positive and negative numbers. It is easy to show that a continuous map from a connected space $X$ to another space $Y$ must map $X$ into just one connected component of $Y$ : in our case, this contradicts the fact that $f$ takes both positive and negative values. Therefore $f$ must be equal to zero at some point, and the proof is complete.
