There are two opposed types of stupidity.
- The first is the (occasionally) hyperintelligent subject who just doesn't "get it", <u>who understands a situation logically, but simply misses its hidden contextual rules</u>.
- The second and opposite figure of stupidity is that of the moron: the stupidity of those who fully identify with common sense, <u>who fully stand for the "big Other" of appearances</u>.
- [[less_than_nothing.pdf#page=12|See example here]]

### The tripartite idiot-imbecile-moron
- The idiot (IQ of 0-25) is simply alone, outside the big Other.
- The moron (IQ of 51-70) is within it (dwelling in language in a stupid way).
- The imbecile（IQ of 26-50）is in between the two-aware of the need for the big Other, but not relying on it, distrusting it.

"Eppur si muove" replaces the usual "The truth is out there", meaning that, even if their existence is denied by official science, alien monsters nonetheless move around out there.

It shouldn't be done, because it can't be done.
