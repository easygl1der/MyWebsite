## ✍内容
A poset $\displaystyle (A,\leq)$ may be regarded as  a category whose objects are the elements $\displaystyle a\in A$ and in which a morphism $\displaystyle a\to a'$ is present if and only if $\displaystyle a\leq a'$. 
The supremum of a collection of elements $\displaystyle \{a_{i}\}_{i \in I}$, an example of a <u>colimit</u> in the category $\displaystyle (A,\leq)$, has a universal property: namely to prove that
$$
\sup_{i\in I}a_{i}\leq a
$$
Limit has a dual universal property that specializes to the universal property of the infimum of a collection of elements in a poset.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Transitivity of the relation “$≤$” implies that the required composite morphisms exist. Reflexivity implies that identity morphisms exist.
