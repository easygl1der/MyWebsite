> [!NOTE]
> A number of important facts about natural transformations are proven by diagram chasing.

The upshot is that categories, functors, and natural transformations assemble into a 2-dimensional categorical structure called a *2-category*, a definition that is stated at the conclusion.
> [!def]
> Indeed, for any fixed pair of categories $\displaystyle \mathrm{C}$ and $\displaystyle \mathrm{D}$, there is a **functor category** $\displaystyle \mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{C}}$ whose *objects are functors* $\displaystyle \mathrm{C}\to \mathrm{D}$ and whose *morphisms are natural transformations*.


> [!NOTE]
> If $\displaystyle \mathrm{C}$ and $\displaystyle \mathrm{D}$ are small, then $\displaystyle \mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{C}}$ is again a small category, but if $\displaystyle \mathrm{C}$ and $\displaystyle \mathrm{D}$ are locally small, then $\displaystyle \mathrm{D}^{\mathrm{C}}$ need not be. This is only guaranteed if $\displaystyle \mathrm{D}$ is locally small and $\displaystyle \mathrm{C}$ is small.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> In summary, the formation of functor categories defines a bifunctor $\displaystyle\text{Cat}^{\text{op}}\times\text{Cat}\to\text{Cat}$ or $\displaystyle\text{Cat}^{\text{op}}\times\text{CAT}\to\text{CAT}$, but the category of functors between two non-locally small categories may be even larger than these categories are.
