[[philmat_4.3.209.pdf#page=4&annotation=254R|That is to say, the topologist does not care to distinguish among homeomorphic spaces by examining the set-theoretical structure of the points of a space, nor does the geometer wonder about the ordinal rank of a given smooth manifold.]]

Such a category will be called a 'topos'.]]
