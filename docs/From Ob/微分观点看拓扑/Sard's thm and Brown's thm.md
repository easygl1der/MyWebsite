More generally consider a smooth map $f: M \rightarrow N$, from a manifold of dimension $m$ to a manifold of dimension $n$. Let $C$ be the set of all $x \varepsilon M$ such that
$$
d f_x: T M_x \rightarrow T N_{f(x)}
$$
has rank less than $n$ (i.e. <u>is not onto</u>). Then $C$ will be called the set of critical points, $f(C)$ the set of critical values, and the complement $N-f(C)$ the set of regular values of $f$. (This agrees with our previous definitions in the case $m=n$.) Since $M$ can be covered by a countable collection of neighborhoods each diffeomorphic to an open subset of $R^m$, we have:
