A map $\displaystyle f:U\to V$ is called smooth if all of its partial derivatives exist and are continuous.
More generally let $\displaystyle X\subset \mathbb{R}^{k},Y\subset \mathbb{R}^{l}$ be arbitrary subsets of euclidean spaces, a map $\displaystyle f:X\to Y$ is called *smooth* if $\displaystyle \forall x\in X,\exists U\overset{ \text{open} }{ \subset }\mathbb{R}^{k}$ containing $x$ and a smooth mapping $\displaystyle F:U\to \mathbb{R}^{l}$ that coincides with $f$ through $\displaystyle U\cap X$.

> A map $\displaystyle f:X\to Y$ is called a *diffeomorphism* if $f$ carries $X$ homeomorphically onto $Y$ and if both $f$ and $\displaystyle f^{-1}$ are smooth.

But we do not want to look at completely arbitrary sets $X$.

For manifolds of demension zero, by definition, $M$ is a manifold of dimension zero if each $\displaystyle x\in M$ has a neighborhood $\displaystyle W\cap M$ consisting of $x$ alone.
> [!EXAMPLE]

> For $\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}<1$, parametrizes the region $\displaystyle z>0$ of $\displaystyle S^{2}$. Similarly, we obtain parametrizations of the regions $\displaystyle x>0,y>0,x<0,y<0,z<0$. Since these cover $\displaystyle S^{2}$, it follows that $\displaystyle S^{2}$ is a <u>smooth manifold</u>.

More generally, $\displaystyle S^{n-1}\subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is smooth manifold of dimension $\displaystyle n-1$.
A somewhat wilder exmaple of a smooth manifold is given by the set of all $\displaystyle (x, y)\in \mathbb{R}^{2}$ with $\displaystyle x\neq0$ and $\displaystyle y=\sin(1/x)$.
### Tangent spaces and derivatives
To define the notion of derivatives $\displaystyle df_{x}$ for a smooth map $\displaystyle f:M\to N$ of smooth manifolds, we first associate with each $\displaystyle x\in M\subset \mathbb{R}^{k}$ a linear subspace $\displaystyle TM_{x}\subset \mathbb{R}^{k}$ of dimension $m$ called the *tangent space* of $M$ at $x$. Then $\displaystyle df_{x}$ will be a linear mapping from $\displaystyle TM_{x}$ to $\displaystyle TN_{y}$, where $\displaystyle y=f(x)$. Elements of the vector space $\displaystyle TM_{x}$ are called *tangent vectors* to $M$ at $x$.
Intuitively one thinks of the $m$ -dimensional hyperplane in $\displaystyle \mathbb{R}^{k}$ which best approximates $M$ near x; then $\displaystyle TM_{x}$ is the hyperplane through the origin that is parallel to this. Similarly one thinks of the <u>nonhomogeneous linear mapping</u> from the tangent hyperplane at $x$ to the tangent hyperplane at $y$ which best approximates $f$. Translating both hyperplanes to the origin, one obtains $\displaystyle df_{x}$.
Before giving the actual dedinition, we must study the special case of mappings between open sets. For any open set $\displaystyle U\subset \mathbb{R}^{k}$ the *tangent space* $\displaystyle TU_{x}$ is defined to be the entire vector space $\displaystyle \mathbb{R}^{k}$. For any smooth map $\displaystyle f:U\to V$ the *derivative*
$$
df_{x}:\mathbb{R}^{k}\to \mathbb{R}^{l}
$$
is defined by the formular
$$
df_{x}(h)=\lim_{ t \to 0 } \frac{f(x+th)-f(x)}{t}
$$
for $\displaystyle x\in U, h\in \mathbb{R}^{k}$. Clearly $\displaystyle df_{x}(h)$ is a linear function of $h$. (In fact, $\displaystyle df_{x}$ is just that linear maping which corresponds to the $\displaystyle l\times k$ matrix $\displaystyle (\frac{ \partial f_{i} }{ \partial x_{j} })_{x}$ of first partial derivatives, evaluated at $x$.)
Here are two fundamental properties of the derivative operation:
1. Chain rule: $\displaystyle d(g\circ f)_{x}=dg_{y}\circ df_{x}$.
2. If $\displaystyle I$ is the identity map of $U$, then $\displaystyle dI_{x}$ is the identity map of $\displaystyle \mathbb{R}^{k}$. More generally, if $\displaystyle U\subset U'$ are open sets and $\displaystyle i:U\to U'$ is the inclusion map, then again $\displaystyle di_{x}$ is the identity map of $\displaystyle \mathbb{R}^{k}$.
3. If $\displaystyle L:\mathbb{R}^{k}\to \mathbb{R}^{l}$ is a linear mapping, then $\displaystyle dL_{x}=L$.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If $f$ is a diffeomorphism between open sets $\displaystyle U\subset \mathbb{R}^{k}$ and $\displaystyle V\subset \mathbb{R}^{l}$, then $k$ must equal $l$, and the linear mapping $\displaystyle df_{x}:\mathbb{R}^{k}\to \mathbb{R}^{l}$ must be nonsingular. [[Chat-2024_09_11-23_50_45|What's nonsingular?]]

Proof: $k$ must equals to $l$, since $f$ is diffeomorphism.
> [!thm] Inverse Function thm
> If the derivative $\displaystyle df_{x}:\mathbb{R}^{k}\to \mathbb{R}^{k}$ is nonsingular, then $f$ maps any sufficiently small open set $\displaystyle U'$ about $x$ diffeomorphically onto an open set $\displaystyle f(U')$.

> [!NOTE]
> $f$ may not be one-one in the large, even if every $\displaystyle df_{x}$ is nonsingular. (An instructive exmaple is provided by the exponential mapping of the complex plane into itself.)

Now let us define the *tangent* space $\displaystyle TM_{x}$ for an arbitrary smooth manifold $\displaystyle M\subset \mathbb{R}^{k}$. Choose a parametrization
$$
g:U\to M\subset \mathbb{R}^{k}
$$
of a neighborhood $\displaystyle g(U)$ of $x$ in $M$, with $\displaystyle g(u)=x$. Here $U$ is an open subset of $\displaystyle \mathbb{R}^{m}$, Think of $g$ as a mapping from $U$ to $\displaystyle \mathbb{R}^{k}$, so that the derivarive
$$
dg_{u}:\mathbb{R}^{m}\to \mathbb{R}^{k}
$$
is defined. Set $\displaystyle TM_{x}$ equal to the image $\displaystyle dg_{u}(\mathbb{R}^{m})$ of $\displaystyle dg_{u}$.
We must prove that this construction does not depend on the particular choice of parametrization $g$. Let $\displaystyle h:V\to M\subset \mathbb{R}^{k}$ be another parametrization of a neighborhood $\displaystyle h(V)$ of $x$ in $M$, and let $\displaystyle v=h^{-1}(x)$. Then $\displaystyle h^{-1}\circ g$ maps some neighborhood $\displaystyle U_{1}$ of $u$ diffeomorphically onto a neighborhood $\displaystyle V_{1}$ of $v$.

### Regular values
$\displaystyle f:X\to Y$ is smooth map between manifolds of the same dimension. We say that $\displaystyle x\in M$ is a *regular point* of $f$ if the derivative $\displaystyle df_{x}$ is nonsingular. In this case it follows from the inverse function theorem that $f$ maps a neighborhood of $x$ in $M$ diffeomophically onto an open set in $N$. The point $\displaystyle y\in N$ is called a *regular value* if $\displaystyle f^{-1}(y)$ contains only regular points.
If $\displaystyle df_{x}$ is singular, then $x$ is called a *critical point* of $f$, and the image $\displaystyle f(x)$ is called a *critical value*. Thus each $\displaystyle y\in N$ is either a critical value or a regular value according as $\displaystyle f^{-1}(y)$ does or does not contain a critical point.
Observe that if $M$ is <u>compact</u> and $\displaystyle y\in N$ is a <u>regular value</u>, then $\displaystyle f^{-1}(y)$ is a <u>finite set</u> (possibly empty). For $\displaystyle f^{-1}(y)$ is any case compact, being a <u>closed subset of the compact space</u> $M$ ; and $\displaystyle f^{-1}(y)$ is <u>discrete</u>, since $f$ is <u>one-one in a neighborhood</u> of each $\displaystyle x\in f^{-1}(y)$.
For a smooth $\displaystyle f:M\to N$, with $M$ compact, and a regular value $\displaystyle y\in N$, we define $\displaystyle \#f^{-1}(y)$ to be the number of points in $\displaystyle f^{-1}(y)$. The first observation to be made about $\displaystyle \#f^{-1}(y)$ is that it is <u>locally constant</u> as a function of $y$ (where $y$ ranges only through regular values!) i.e., there is a <u>neighborhood</u> $\displaystyle \textcolor{green} {V\subset N}$ of $y$ such that $\displaystyle \# f ^{-1}(y')=\# f^{-1}(y)$ for any $\displaystyle y'\in V$. 
Let $\displaystyle x_{1},\dots,x_{k}$ be the points of $\displaystyle f^{-1}(y)$, and choose pairwise disjoint neighborhoods $\displaystyle U_{1},\dots,U_{k}$ of these which are mapped diffeomorphically onto neighborhoods $\displaystyle V_{1},\dots ,V_{k}$ in $N$. We may then take
$$
V=V_{1}\cap V_{2}\cap\dots \cap V_{k}-f(M-U_{1}-\dots-U_{k}).
$$
