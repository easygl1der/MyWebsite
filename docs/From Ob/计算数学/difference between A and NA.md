## ✍内容
The student should appreciate this as another example of the basic difference between numerical analysis and analysis. Analysis became a precise discipline when it left the restrictions of practical calculations to deal entirely with problems posed in terms of an abstract model of the number system, called the real numbers. This abstract model is designed to make a precise and useful definition of limit possible, which opens the way to the abstract or symbolic solution of an impressive array of practical problems, once these problems are translated into the terms of the model. This still leaves the task of translating the abstract or symbolic solutions back into practical solutions. Numerical analysis assumes this task, and with it the limitations of practical calculations from which analysis managed to escape so elegantly. Numerical answers are therefore usually tentative and, at best, known to be accurate only to within certain bounds.
