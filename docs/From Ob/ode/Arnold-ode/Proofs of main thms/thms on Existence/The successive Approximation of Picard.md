## ✍内容
Consider the differential equation $\displaystyle \dot{\boldsymbol{x}}=\boldsymbol{v}(t,x)$. Define the *Picard mapping* to be the mapping $A$ that takes the function $\displaystyle \varphi:t\mapsto \boldsymbol{x}$ to the function $\displaystyle A\varphi:t\mapsto \boldsymbol{x}$, where
$$
(A\varphi)(t)=\boldsymbol{x}_{0}+\int_{t_{0}}^{t} \boldsymbol{v}(\tau,\varphi(\tau)) \, d\tau
$$
And the followings are equivalent:
- $\displaystyle \varphi$ is a solution with the initial condition $\displaystyle \varphi(t_{0})=x_{0}$
- $\displaystyle \varphi=A\varphi$

> To prove the convergence of the successive approximations we shall construct a complete metric space in which the Picard mapping is a contraction. We begin by recalling some facts from analysis.
