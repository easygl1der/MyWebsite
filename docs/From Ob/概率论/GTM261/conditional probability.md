## Motivation
Let $H$ be an event. Fix $\omega$ in $\Omega$. Suppose that all that is known about $\omega$ is that it is in $H$. Based on this information, our best estimate of $X(\omega)$ should be the "average" of $X$ over $H$, namely, the number
$$
\mathbb{E}_H X=\frac{1}{\mathbb{P}(H)} \int_H X d \mathbb{P}=\frac{1}{\mathbb{P}(H)} \mathbb{E} X 1_H
$$
The number $\displaystyle \mathbb{E}_{H}X$ is called the *conditional expectation* of $X$ given the event $H$. 
Suppose, next, that $\mathcal{F}$ is generated by a measurable partition $\left(H_n\right)$ of $\Omega$. For fixed $\omega$ again, consider what our estimate of $X(\omega)$ should be if we were given the information $\mathcal{F}$. Given $\mathcal{F}$, we shall be able to tell which one of the events $H_1, H_2, \ldots$ includes $\omega$, and if it were $H_n$ that included $\omega$ then our estimate $\bar{X}(\omega)$ would be $\mathbb{E}_{H_n} X$. In other words,
$$
\bar{X}(\omega)=\sum_n\left(\mathbb{E}_{H_n} X\right) 1_{H_n}(\omega)
$$
